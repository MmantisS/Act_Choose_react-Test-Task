"But as all wishgranters do, she perverted that wish, opening the Dreaming City to Dûl Incaru. "
"When you defeated Dûl Incaru in turn, I reset the entire Dreaming City to keep her permanently occupied battling you. "
"You must use these loops to find a way to permanently destroy her."
narrator "Medusa's body falls silent in your arms."
